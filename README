WWW::WCAP          adpOg  Access to a WCAP-enabled calendar server  NATE

INSTALLATION:
    WWW::WCAP uses the following modules/distributions.

	LWP::UserAgent	 - required (for communicating WCAP with server)
	Date::Calc	 - required (for parsing calendar entries)
	Benchmark::Timer - optional (for tests)

    First ensure the above modules/distributions are installed (perhaps
    by using a command such as 'perl -e "use LWP::UserAgent; use \
    Date::Calc; use Benchmark::Timer;"') then build/test/install WWW::WCAP
    by doing:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    This module contains documentation on the object and its methods.
    Once installed you can use the 'perldoc WWW::WCAP' command to
    obtain the documentation.  This package also includes several
    test scripts with example code.

*******************************************************************************
COMPATIBILITY:
    This module was developed on Mac OS X 10.2.6, and has been tested on
    Red Hat (v8) Linux (kernel 2.4)

TODO:
    Change to an object rather than procedural calls
    Support all WCAP functions
    Synchronise with other calendar servers and clients (e.g. CS&T,
    Sunbird (Mozilla calendar), OS X iCal).
