Self test suite for the WCAP modules
------------------------------------

Tests are invoked by running the ./TEST script, but usually you run the
tests with "make test" at the top WWW::WCAP directory.  Use -v option
for verbose tests.  You might run an individual test like this:

  ./TEST -v base/wcap

or all tests in a directory like this

  ./TEST base
